I'm a data scientist and research engineer. I held various roles as individual contributor and manager at large corporations and start-ups. The last couple years, I was fortunate to focus on making privacy-perserving machine learning accessible to practitioners. Two examples of my work are [TF-Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted), a framework for encrypted machine learning in TensorFlow and [Moose](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/moose), a secure distributed dataflow framework for encrypted machine learning.

The goal of this blog is to explore my passion for machine learning, privacy and other techincal subjects.

In my free time, you can find me surfing at Ocean Beach (I grew up in a surf town in Southwestern France), playing jazz, indoor rock climbing and looking for a good pastrami on rye in the Bay Area.
