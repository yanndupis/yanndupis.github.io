    "In the recent years, we saw tremendous progress across all the machine learning tasks from image classification, object detection, translation, question answering, text classification etc. Main drivers of this progress are more compute, data, new training approaches such as transfer learning, but also more sophisticated neural network architectures. Fortunately these models are available at out fingertips. If you tackle a computer vision task, you can leverage the [ Pytorch Image Models (timm)](https://timm.fast.ai/#List-Models-with-Pretrained-Weights) library. As of now it contains more than 50 different type of architectures translating into 600 models which have [different trade offs](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best) in terms of accuracy and inference time depending on the task. For NLP, you can use the popular [transformer library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from HuggingFace which offers almost [80k models](https://huggingface.co/models) based on about 140 different type of architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these neural network architectures built upon one another by the research community, were able to achieve better performance thanks to very carefully hand crafted [inductive bias](https://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2020-05/recurrence) for each specific task. For example, CNNs used in computer vision models such as ResNet have a locality bias where they assume close pixels are related to each other. LSTMs which used to be popular for NLP tasks before Transformers appeared, have a sequential bias where they process each element of a sequence one after another. However because the inductive bias is hand crafted for a specific task, existing architectures are often not able to generalize across multiple modalities. The Perceiver IO ([Jaegle et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795)) architecture released by DeepMind in 2021 aim to solve this challenge and demonstrate they can achieve strong results across a wide variety of single-modal and multi-modal tasks such as: GLUE language benchmark, predicting optical flow between images, image classification, multi-modal video + audio classification, audio-video-label multi-modal autoencoding etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we will implement a Perceiver IO architecture from scratch and we will apply it to two different domains: image classification and text classification. In conjunction to this blog post, I highly recommend watching [Drew Jaegle's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZ3o36lXoQ) who's the main author of the Perceiver IO paper, and also read [this HuggingFace's blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/perceiver). These resources in addition to training several Perceiver models with the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) inspired me to implement this architecture from scratch."

    "The Perceiver architecture is based on the Transformer architecture ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)). As described in [Drew Jaegle's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZ3o36lXoQ), the main benefits of transformers are:\n",

    "### Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an intuition about the self-attention mechanism, I highly recommend [Peter Bloem's blog post](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) or the natural language processing with transformers [book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/). Later in this post, we will demonstrate how the perceiver can be applied to images. But let's assume for now that our input is a sentence where each words of the sentence are represented by token embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The self attention mechanism consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project the input (token embeddings in our case) into a query, key and values\n",
    "- Compute the similarity between the query and the key using a dot product. The result of the dot product represents the attention scores.\n",
    "- Multiply the attention scores by a scaling factor to normalize their variance and apply a softmax so each column of the matrix, representing the attention weights, sum up to 1.\n",
    "- Compute the dot product between the attention weights and the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the self-attention mechanism is to produce a new representation of the token embeddings where now each new embeddings is a linear combination (or weighted average) of the ordinal embeddings. This allow us to encode some contextual information. For example, we have the following sentence: \"The tree bark is rough to the touch.\" and \"I hope her dog doesn’t bark when I knock on the door.\" In the two sentences, we have the word bark but with a different meaning. In the first sentence, bark refers to the tree and in the second sentence it refers to the dog. When applying the self attention mechanism to the embedding bark, the new embedding should give more weights to the word tree in the first sentence and dog in the second one in order to encode this context.

The input gets first encoded into a latent array, then the latent representation gets refined via several processing layers. Finally, the latent gets decoded into an output. As you can see on the diagram below, the encoder and decoder are using a cross-attention module, and the processor is using a self-attention module. WHat's amazing with the perceiver architecture is that it can handle any modalities thanks to the encoder and decoder modules. And the size of the inputs and outputs is not a problem anymore since they both use a cross-attention module where the latent size is independent of the input size. \n",

But for this example, we will use another approach used in the paper where they flatten the pixels by applying a 1D convolution and add learned absolute positional 1D position embeddings.
