    "In recent years, we saw tremendous progress across all machine learning tasks from image classification, object detection, and translation, to question answering, text classification, and more. Main drivers of this progress are more compute resources, data, new training approaches such as transfer learning, and also more sophisticated neural network architectures. Fortunately these models are available at our fingertips. If you tackle a computer vision task, you can leverage the [Pytorch Image Models (timm)](https://timm.fast.ai/#List-Models-with-Pretrained-Weights) library. As of now it contains more than 50 different types of architectures translating into 600 models which have [different trade-offs](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best) in terms of accuracy and inference time, depending on the task. For NLP, you can use the popular [transformer library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from HuggingFace which offers almost [80k models](https://huggingface.co/models) based on about 140 different types of architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these neural network architectures, built upon each other by the research community, were able to achieve better performance thanks to very carefully hand-crafted [inductive bias](https://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2020-05/recurrence) for each specific task. For example, CNNs used in computer vision models such as ResNet have a locality bias where they assume close pixels are related to each other. LSTMs, which used to be popular for NLP tasks before Transformers appeared, have a sequential bias where they process each element of a sequence one after another. However, because the inductive bias is hand-crafted for a specific task, existing architectures are often not able to generalize across multiple modalities. The Perceiver IO ([Jaegle et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795)) architecture released by DeepMind in 2021 aims to solve this challenge and demonstrate they can achieve strong results across a wide variety of single-modal and multi-modal tasks such as: GLUE language benchmark, predicting optical flow between images, image classification, multi-modal video + audio classification, audio-video-label multi-modal autoencoding, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we will implement a Perceiver IO architecture from scratch and we will apply it to two different domains: image classification and text classification. In conjunction to this blog post, I highly recommend watching the main author of the Perceiver IO paper [Drew Jaegle's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZ3o36lXoQ), and reading [this HuggingFace blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/perceiver). These resources, in addition to training several Perceiver models with the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), inspired me to implement this architecture from scratch."

    "## Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perceiver architecture is based on the Transformer architecture ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)). In this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZ3o36lXoQ), Drew Jaegle describes why transformers are a good candidate for general purpose architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They don't make specific assumptions about the domain.\n",
    "- They have general purpose inductive bias.\n",
    "- Position is a feature instead of being a constraint.\n",
    "- They mainly use matmuls, which are efficiently computed by GPU and TPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cons are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Attention scales quadratically based on the input. \n",
    "- Multilayer perceptron (MLP) scales linearly based on the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers consist of: a self-attention module, multilayer perceptron (also called feed-forward layer), layer normalization, and skip connections. But really the heart of the transformers is their self-attention module, which the Perceiver architecture innovatively modified to make the module scalable. So let's first implement the self-attention module, understand why it scales quadratically, and learn how the Perceiver architecture addresses this challenge.\n",

    "### Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "To build up some intuition about the self-attention mechanism, I highly recommend [Peter Bloem's blog post](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) or the natural language processing with transformers [book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/). Later in this post, we will demonstrate how the perceiver can be applied to images. But let's assume for now that our input is a sentence where each word of the sentence is represented by token embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The self-attention mechanism consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project the input (token embeddings in our case) into a query, key and value.\n",
    "- Compute the similarity between the query and the key using a dot product. The result of the dot product represents the attention scores.\n",
    "- Multiply the attention scores by a scaling factor to normalize their variance and apply a softmax so each column of the matrix, representing the attention weights, sums up to 1.\n",
    "- Compute the dot product between the attention weights and the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the self-attention mechanism is to produce a new representation of the token embeddings where now each new embeddings is a linear combination (or weighted average) of the original embeddings. This allows us to encode some contextual information. For example, we have the following sentence: \"The tree bark is rough to the touch\" and \"I hope her dog doesn’t bark when I knock on the door.\" In these two sentences, we have the word \"bark\" but each has a different meaning. In the first sentence, \"bark\" refers to the tree, and in the second sentence it refers to the dog. When applying the self-attention mechanism to the embedding \"bark\" the new embedding should give more weight to the word \"tree\" in the first sentence and \"dog\" in the second one in order to encode this context.

Because the output of the self-attention module scales linearly based on the input, the MLP layer will also scale linearly based on the input.\n",

    "The Perceiver architecture consists of three main build blocks: encoder, processor and decoder. The input gets first encoded into a latent array, then the latent representation gets refined via several processing layers. Finally, the latent gets decoded into an output. As you can see in the diagram below, the encoder and decoder are using a cross-attention module, and the processor is using a self-attention module. What's amazing with the Perceiver architecture is that it can handle any modalities thanks to the encoder and decoder modules. Additionally, the size of the inputs and outputs is not a problem anymore since they both use a cross-attention module where the latent size is independent of the input size. \n",

    "To train this model we will use the Adam optimizer with weight decay from Pytorch because we're working with a simple dataset. However, in practice, it's recommended to use an Adam algorithm with a fix weight decay as introduced in Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization ([Loshchilov et al, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101)). You can find an implementation in the [transformer library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules#transformers.AdamW). It's also recommended to use a scheduler with a warm-up phase. If you want to learn more about the importance of using adaptive optimizers and learning rate warm-up when training transformers from scratch, I highly recommend [this blog post](https://www.borealisai.com/research-blogs/tutorial-17-transformers-iii-training/) from Borealise AI."

    "Unfortunately, when training the model with this tokenizer to classify the articles, I discovered the model was converging very slowly and didn't give strong results. Instead, we will use a simple word tokenizer. I think one of the reasons I was getting poor results on this task with the byte tokenizer was because the presence of certain words is highly correlated with the topics in the news articles. Here, we are training the model from scratch, so the model starts without a language representation. Therefore it's harder for the model to identify that certain sequences of bytes represents certain words which are relevant to the classification tasks. Usually these models get pre-trained on a masked language modeling task (fill in the missing/masked word in the sentence) to build a language representation, then gets fine-tuned on a text classification task. During the first step the model is able to build a language representation using the bytes tokenizer. As demonstrated in the paper, the authors get very strong results on the Glue benchmark. I tried to fine-tune a Perceiver IO model from the transformer library using a byte tokenizer on this task, and I also got good results. Therefore, the challenges probably appear when training the model from scratch with byte tokenizers on certain tasks such as text classification."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By showing you how we can implement this architecture from scratch, I hope I've given you a better idea about how the Perceiver architecture can solve a wide variety of tasks by just modifying the pre-processing and post-processing steps while keeping the rest of the architecture tasks agnostic. In this post, we focused our efforts on image classification and text classification tasks, but there's still so much more you can do. In the [transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/perceiver), as well as Niels Rogge's [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/perceiver), you can learn how to implement other pre-processor and post-processor modules to tackle a wide variety of tasks, such as masked language model, optical flow, and more. We could easily extend these modules to question answering or object detection as well. Where this architecture really shines is with multi-modal tasks. One example is this [multi-modal auto-encoding](https://huggingface.co/blog/perceiver#perceiver-for-multimodal-autoencoding) task where the authors were able to accurately reconstruct multi-modal inputs consisting of a sequence of images, audio recordings, and class labels. In the perceiver IO paper, the authors were even able to replace the original transformer model in AlphaStar ([Arulkumaran et al, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01724Honestly)) and match state-of-the-art results. Honestly, the possibilities are endless, so go have fun :). "
